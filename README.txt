Please download & Install Couch DB (http://couchdb.apache.org/#download), and go to "http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils". After that, create a database and name it "usercredentials".
Next, download & install MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/), and go to where it was installed. There's a folder called "htdocs" inside the MAMP folder (MAMP->htdocs). Copy the file provided "Simpleform" to "htdocs". Now, everything is ready and set. Start MAMP, and start the servers. Next, go to a browser, and write this address "localhost/Simpleform".
